## Shortcomings
**Limited Pagination**: Presently, the API returns all data at once, which may lead to performance issues when dealing with a large dataset. Pagination is not implemented, resulting in the retrieval of all data in bulk. To enhance performance and optimize response time, it is recommended to implement pagination. This would involve fetching only the necessary data in smaller, manageable portions as needed.
